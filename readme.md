# Lively Shuffle

## What is Lively Shuffle?
Lively Shuffle enhances the **Lively Wallpaper** experience by allowing you to **randomize your wallpapers**, a feature that Lively does not natively support. From the system tray menu, it also provides:
- **Switching on demand** to the next random wallpaper.
- **Customizable shuffle delay** for better control over your wallpaper transitions.

## Requirements
To build and run Lively Shuffle, you need:
- **Windows 10 or 11**
- **MinGW-w64** (for compiling on Windows)
- **Lively Wallpaper** (Download: [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/))
- **LivelyCU** (Command Line Tool for Lively)
- **Lively PATH variable** (Recommended for easy access)

## Compilation Instructions
Open a terminal in the project directory and run the following commands:

```sh
windres dialog.rc -o dialog.o
g++ -o lively_shuffle.exe lively_shuffle.cpp dialog.o -std=c++17 -mwindows -lstdc++fs
```

This will generate `lively_shuffle.exe`, which you can use to shuffle wallpapers in Lively.
